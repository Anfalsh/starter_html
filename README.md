# Bulp Starter Package!

Before your eyes is the starter package for using Bulp. Bulp is a basic gulp build system that supports concatenation, minification, image optimization, and renaming of files. It also comes packed other goodies such as autoprefixer and uglification as well as browser sync so no more hassles of refreshing the browser everytime you want to see the output of the modified code.

Also within this package is a `src` directory and a `dist` directory for non-compiled and production ready code. The file structure is already set up and includes Boostrap as a starting point, if you are in to that sort of thing. Just add code to your `styles.scss`, `*.html` files, and `app.js` file, run `gulp` in the terminal, and watch MAGIC unfold before your eyes!
